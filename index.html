				<h2> The legend! </h2>

				<p>Tetris is a legendary video game, originally created by 
				the Russian game designer and computer engineer Alexey Pajitnov. 
				It's first version was developed while Pajitnov was working as 
				an Artificial Intelligence researcher at the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
				in the Computer Center in Moscow. </p> 

				<p> Alexey was tasked with testing the capabilities of hardware, which
					he did by writing simple games for the machines. Tetris was a game he
					wrote for the Electronika 60, a microcomputer that only had text capabilities.
					So, the first version of Tetris had text-characters for graphics. </p>

				<p> Originally, the game was supposed to be about filling lines by combining pieces,
					however, because that made the screen fill up very quickly, Pajitnov decided to 
				delete the filled lines, thus creating the core mechanic of Tetris gameplay </p>

				<p> The game has been ported for nearly every operating system and computing device 
					after it's original version, including IBM PCs, Nintendo consoles, handleld devices,
					calculators, and probably a bus. </p>

				<h2> What is this project? </h2>

				<p> Developed in modern C++17, this project aims to be the best implementation
				of Tetris I can possibly make. It is a passion project, and it is still in super
				early development. The game is targeted at Linux systems, for we embrace open source
				platforms. The game itself is open source, and released under the BSD 3 license.
				Feel free to modify it or fork our github repository at will. </p>

				<p> In the future, I want this to be the <strong> best </strong>, <strong> most well 
				documented </strong> and <strong>most expandable</strong> version of Tetris ever made,
				but at this point, this is still a distant dream. I want <strong>this very website</strong>
				to be a source of information and inspiration for Tetris fans worldwide. I don't want to 
				make just another Tetris game, I want to make a tetris <strong> ecosystem</strong>. </p>
